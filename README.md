# Introduction

This project is the open source openD developer's framework. The purpose of this project is to provide a framework which defines a **unified API** for DECT Ultra Low Energy (ULE) fixed and portable part devices designed to support various hardware platforms.

The idea of the openD framework is to make the DECT ULE technology available to enable a fast and easy development of DECT ULE devices. The framework provides sample codes, tutorials and documentation.

The repository contains a Doxygen documentation which is available here:

[OpenD Doxygen Documentation](http://stackforce.github.io/openD-doc/index.html)

The documentation contains the description of the API, source code examples and information about the software architecture.

# OpenD Community

The openD community is the place where you can find all information around DECT ULE and the openD framework. It is the place where developers come together to discuss DECT ULE and openD related topics and to exchange information and know-how. You will also find much more:

- News and events about openD and DECT ULE
- General information regarding the openD project
- Information about manufacturers and supported hardware
- Forums
- Blogs
- Live chat

The openD community website is currently under construction and will be published soon.
